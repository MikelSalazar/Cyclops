# Cyclops
A small AR-based FPS game created at the AR Hackathon 2016

<<<<<<< HEAD
This repository contains the complete Unity project folder, a PDF with the AR marker and the resulting APK. The idea of this project was to create a simple physics-based game that can be played in current AR See-through Head-Mounted Displays (by creating an AR Marker that could be placed on the floor, circumventing the problems associated with the small FOV of current HMDs).
