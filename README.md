# Cyclops
A small AR-based FPS game created at the AR Hackathon 2016

This repository contains the complete Unity project folder, a PDF with the AR marker and the resulting APK. 
The idea of this project was to create a simple physics-based game that can be played in current AR See-through Head-Mounted Displays (by creating an AR Marker that could be placed on the floor, circumventing the problems associated with the small FOV of current HMDs).

This project was created with Unity 5.2 and Vuforia 5.5
